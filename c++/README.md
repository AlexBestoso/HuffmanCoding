# Huffman Coding - c++ : BLOCKED

Development Notes : 
	The pack byte function has had it's container size corrected;
	but we now have an error where the second portion of the byte isn't properly 
	pushed into the body array cell.

	Review all things greater than 8 bit,
	review all things less than 8 bit.
