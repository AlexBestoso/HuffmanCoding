# Huffman Coding - c++

Development Notes : 

We have in the debug output file a sample run that produces an error. 
Review this error to find out what part of the generated tree is causing the error.

Then we have to trace the code table generation process to see why the bit deriviation isn't functioning as expected.


1) troubleshoot the indecie error.
2) troubleshoot the invalid code table error.
