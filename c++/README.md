# Huffman Coding - c++

Development Notes : 

Attack plan: 

- Create debug function for testing getSubIndecies to ensure all one and zero values work as expected.
	1) generate the tree
	2) go through each layer 1 by 1 to check the getSubIndecies results
	3) using the same frequency data, generate a tree by hand to verify sub indecies.
