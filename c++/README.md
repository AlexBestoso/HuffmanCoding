# Huffman Coding - c++ : BLOCKED

Development Notes : 
	- we gotta get the first chunk before entering the loop.
	- we then need to either remove bits or add bits to that chunk depending on our sherrection.
	- a value has to be created that tells our bit index relative to our chunk.
		which is different from the bit index of our output buffer.
