# HuffmanCoding - Work In Progress
Huffman Coding implemented in C++ and JavaScript

Fully corrected the packing bytes…for now.

We have gotten back to the invalid message error that this branch is supposed to address…finally.

Next step is to use the newly created packing/unpacking functions to fix the body packing/unpacking. 

Because as of writing this, it's still using the old broken algorithm.
