# HuffmanCoding - Work In Progress
Huffman Coding implemented in C++ and JavaScript

Goal : build a dedicated `packByte()` function and a dedicated `unpackByte()` function.

cloned from : https://github.com/AlexBestoso/HuffmanCoding/tree/24-decompress---invalid-message

Notes: 
- we have a `packByte()` function now, it appears to work.
- We are getting a failure when re-generating the tree via extration. Meaning we now nead a universial `unpackByte()` function.
