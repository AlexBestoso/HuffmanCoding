# HuffmanCoding - Work In Progress
Huffman Coding implemented in C++ and JavaScript
created a getPackedBits function.


TODO: 
the algorithm for extracting the body data, unpackBody()' s for loop that uses `frequencies_s`, it's not too complicated; but it is out of aligmnet.

Therory; It has to do with the potential for inconsistant decrementation in the generated encoded bit lengths. This phenomena is not a bug, and has to be directly addressed.
