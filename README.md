# HuffmanCoding - Work In Progress
Huffman Coding implemented in C++ and JavaScript
created a getPackedBits function.

This function extracts the encoded data from the buffer by reading the buffer via specificed bit chunks.

Due to how the body is packed, There's no need to use the pack function, because interpreatation is dependent on the tree, not the internal data.
