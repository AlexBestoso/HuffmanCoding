# HuffmanCoding - Work In Progress
Huffman Coding implemented in C++ and JavaScript

Goal : build a dedicated `packByte()` function and a dedicated `unpackByte()` function.

cloned from : https://github.com/AlexBestoso/HuffmanCoding/tree/6-test-with-all-256-bytes

Next steps: 
	1) refresh the debug code for the unpack functions again; but this time, with a better focus on the `hi` iterator value, and the data targeted for unpacking.
	IE; Make the bit stream easier to follow for decompression. The compression printouts seems useful enough for now.

	2) Reduce the amount of useless `printf` statements used for debugging.
