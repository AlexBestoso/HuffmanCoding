# HuffmanCoding - Work In Progress
Huffman Coding implemented in C++ and JavaScript

TESTING PHASE!!!!

I've generated the code table, now I need to match that code table with my hand drawn table to see if all the encoded values match up properly.

After this, I'll be ready to add the final touches, such as header generation, packing, and unpacking; as well as the actual application of the encode and decode via table.
